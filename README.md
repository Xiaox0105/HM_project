# Hotel Booking project

This project simulates a simple hotel booking system. 

It allows guests to book rooms of different types, display the bill, and allows the manager to view all existing orders, cancel bookings and change the rate of the rooms through customized policies.

Data is stored through extensive use of 2D arrays

If the guest is trying to book an already alloted rooom, it will return an alternative room suggestions.

Determined room availability by creating Date objects, formatting and parsing dates to match real-life calendar of 2021.
